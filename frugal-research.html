<h2>Benchtop experiments and Frugal Science</h2>

Experiments in schools and early years of university need to be robust and cheap, and exciting. This
has a lot in common with many other science activities. On one end are public outreach and citizen
science. On another end is research faced with significant economic constraints. In
developing countries, outside the best funded laboratories, scientists often turn into “theoreticians”,
as they perceive too much difficulty in attempting experiment driven research. One cannot dispute
that there are areas (advanced condensed matter physics; particle physics; molecular biology) that
cannot be attempted on small budgets. However exciting new science is being done all the time also
with very modest equipment. In the 80s and 90s, chaos was explored with simple electronic circuits.
In the 90s, many key experiments in soft matter physics were published using cheap equipment
(webcams) and consumer products (shaving foam and detergent foam drainage). Experiments on
fluids have a very long tradition that continues these days with simple experiments on swimming
micro-organisms, and granular matter studies have been with very simple kit. Cameras and
computers have seen such drops in cost that one can look back at some experiments that were
challenging and required special instruments a few decades ago, and can now be reproduced
(better!) with a Raspberry Pi computer and its camera.

These concepts have motivated many researchers. Manu Prakash, in Stanford, is well known for
having spoken many times about the value of “frugal research”. Another similar and large
community has taken part over the last decade in the Hands-On-School, an annual graduate school
aimed at early career PIs, post-docs and PhD students from developing countries, based around the
message of empowering experimental research with bench-top experiments. We hope that many of
the experiments demonstrated in the Hands On schools will be presented on the website here soon.
In many cases they are flexible experiments that can take as little as a few hours in the form of a
demonstration, but can be turned into longer investigations and even research projects.
There is something to say about the power of bench-top experiments even in well funded labs.
Often group leaders, and their students, can end up lining up their research questions to the
unique/expensive pieces of equipment that they have. Ok, this is a good use of that equipment. But
to make new discoveries, science research needs to be nurtured by curiosity, and it is important that
skills and resources exist so that researchers can quickly set up and try out new experiments.
