<h2>Droplets and face coverings</h2>
There was a lot of discussion in spring/summer 2020 on the efficiency of face coverings, and various
types of masks, in reducing the spread of droplets. It seemed nobody quite knew if masks would
have a big effect (they probably do, for a variety of reasons). An aerosol is a droplet so small that it
stays floating in air, like fog. When we speak, or breathe, we emit aerosols. But we also emit larger
droplets that travel straight, for some distance.

Various labs tried to make experiments. This here is not a review! We just point to a UK study
<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10720'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10720</a> which used an optical technique to enhance contrast
(Background Oriented Schlieren) and also a study done at NIH that strikes us for its simplicity. A
laser light was optically manipulated to make a “light sheet”, and then the scattering of light from
droplets emitted whilst speaking was captured by a smartphone, together with the audio of the
person speaking. A very interesting video of the experiment is <a href='https://www.nejm.org/do/10.1056/NEJMdo005745/full/?requestType=popUp&amp;relatedArticle=10.1056%2FNEJMc2007800'>here</a>

Imagine such a simple experiment being published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a
publication with Impact Factor 74 !!! Shows what’s possible with a good and important idea (and
tools just need to be “good enough”).
<p>
With the right lighting conditions, it might even be possible to do experiments imaging droplets
without a laser light sheet? If the question is how far droplets fly, it might not be necessary to
capture droplets in air… rather let droplets land (with food coloring?) on white paper, and measure
their sizes and distances? Speaking or coughing through an opening into a box (with food coloring?),
covering the inside of the box with white paper, could analysed to see in which directions droplets
go?
<p>
These are, as far as we know, untested experiments in the context of student projects.
